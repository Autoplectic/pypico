PICO v3
Feel free to direct questions/comments to Marius Millea (mmillea@ucdavis.edu)

* If you just want to call PICO from Python, you don't need to 
  compile anything. Simply add the libpico directory to your 
  PYTHONPATH variable and from Python run "import pypico"

* For the C/Fortran library, in the libpico directory, copy 
  Makefile.inc.example to Makefile.inc and make any necessary 
  platform specific changes to that file. Then run "make".

* For CosmoMC plugin see plugins/cosmomc
