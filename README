PICO (Parameters for the Impatient Cosmologist)
===============================================

Installation
===========================

The easiest way to install *PICO* is via::

    $ pip install pypico

On older platforms which do not have ``pip`` installed you 
can also try::

    $ easy_install pypico

If neither option works, you can manually download the *PICO* 
package from `<http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pypico>`_, then extract it
and run::

    $ python setup.py install
    
    
(If you don't have root access, note that all these commands accept 
the option ``--user`` which installs *PICO* in your home directory.)
    
    
Usage
=====

Once you have *PICO* installed, to do anything you'll need some data files
which actually contain interpolated data. You can find them on 
the PICO website at `<https://sites.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/pico>`_.

After that, typical usage is loading PICO data file::

    >> import pypico
    >> pico = pypico.load_pico("example_pico_file.dat")  

To show possible inputs parameters and output values use::

    >> pico.inputs()
    >> pico.outputs()
    
And finally, to calculate output values, run::

    >> pico.get(**inputs)
    
where ``inputs`` is a dictionary with keys for each input returned 
by ``pico.inputs()``


Installing Plugins for CAMB, CosmoMC, etc..
===========================================

If all you'd like to do it use *PICO* from Python with various data files
then you do not need to do anything in this section. If on the other hand,
you'd like to either

* Plug *PICO* into your code which currently calls ``CAMB_GetResults``
* Plug *PICO* into CosmoMC

then you'll need to follow these instructions. 

When you installed *PICO*, a shared library ``libpico.so`` was created
which allows *PICO* to be called from C, C++, Fortran, or any other 
language which can understand the symbols in the library. To compile and link 
your code against this library, *PICO* provides an easy way to get 
include and link flags on your platform. Simply call::
    
    $ python -c "import pypico; print pypico.get_include()"
    $ python -c "import pypico; print pypico.get_link()"
    
to print out the necessary flags.


CAMB Plugin
-----------

If your code is set up to call the CAMB function ``CAMB_GetResults``, then 
it should be trivial to use the *PICO* version called ``PICO_GetResults`` instead.
The *PICO* version will fall back on the CAMB version if called with parameters
for which it cannot calculate the relevant quantities. 

To install the CAMB plugin, do the following:

* Copy ``plugins/camb/pico_camb.f90`` to the folder containing your code
* Add ``use fpico`` to your code
* Add a call ``fpico_initialize(file)`` to load a *PICO* datafile.
* Replace ``CAMB_GetResults`` with ``PICO_GetResults``
* Compile your code, making sure to use the correct include/link flags (as described above).



CosmoMC Plugin
--------------

*PICO* can also be plugged into CosmoMC. 

To install the CosmoMC plugin, do the following:

* Copy ``plugins/cosmomc/CMB_Cls_picaso.f90`` and ``plugins/camb/pico_camb.f90`` 
  to the CosmoMC source folder
* Replace ``driver.f90`` in the CosmoMC source folder with the one in ``plugins/cosmomc``
* In your CosmoMC Makefile, replace references to ``CMB_Cls_simple`` 
  with references to ``CMB_Cls_pico`` 
* Add the correct include/link flags to the Makefile (as described above).
* Add the a key ``pico_datafile`` to your parameter file.


CosmoSlik Plugin
----------------

To install the CosmoSlik plugin, copy ``plugins/cosmoslik/pico.py`` to 
the ``cosmoslik/models/`` folder.
