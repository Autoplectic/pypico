PICO (Parameters for the Impatient Cosmologist)
===============================================

Installation
============

To install *PICO*, download and extract the package, and from the top folder run::

    python setup.py install


Install notes
-------------
* If you don't have root access, you can append the option ``--user`` 
  which installs *PICO* under your home directory instead of system wide.
* For linking against languages other than Python, *PICO* uses 
  `F2PY <http://www.scipy.org/F2py>`_ to compile the *PICO* library.
  It will try to automatically find C and Fortran compilers installed
  on your system. If this doesn't work, you can give a compiler name by running
  ``python setup.py install`` with the ``--fcompiler=`` and ``--compiler=`` flags.
  You can list valid compiler names with ``--help-fcompiler`` and ``--help-compiler``. 
  You can also directly specify the path to the Fortran compiler with ``--f90exec=``. 
* If you're familiar with installing Python packages, note that ``easy_install pypico`` 
  and ``pip install pypico`` can also be used to automatically download the
  latest version and install it.


Usage
=====   

Once you have *PICO* installed, to do anything you'll need some data files
which actually contain interpolated data. You can find them on 
the PICO website at `<https://sites.google.com/a/ucdavis.edu/pico>`_.

After that, typical usage is loading a PICO data file::

    >> import pypico
    >> pico = pypico.load_pico("example_pico_file.dat")  

To show possible inputs parameters and output values use::

    >> pico.inputs()
    >> pico.outputs()
    
And finally, to calculate output values, run::

    >> pico.get(**inputs)
    
where ``inputs`` is a dictionary with keys for each input returned 
by ``pico.inputs()``


Installing Plugins for CAMB, CosmoMC, etc..
===========================================

If all you'd like to do it use *PICO* from Python with various data files
then you do not need to do anything in this section. If on the other hand,
you'd like to either

* Plug *PICO* into your code which currently calls ``CAMB_GetResults``
* Plug *PICO* into CosmoMC

then you'll need to follow these instructions. 

Linking
-------

When you installed *PICO*, a static library ``libpico.a`` was created
which allows *PICO* to be called from C, C++, Fortran, or any other 
language which can understand the symbols in the library. To link 
your code against this library, *PICO* provides an easy way to get 
include and link flags on your platform. To print out the necessary flags, call::
    
    python -c "import pypico; print pypico.get_include()"
    python -c "import pypico; print pypico.get_link()"
    
You should put these calls directly in your Makefile via::

    $(shell python -c "import pypico; print pypico.get_link()")


Plugin Folder
-------------

You can find the various plugin files in a folder `plugin` in the archive.
If you installed *PICO* via `pip` or `easy_install`, you can find the location
of the plugins by running::

    python -c "import pypico; print pypico.get_folder()"


CAMB Plugin
-----------

If your code is set up to call the CAMB function ``CAMB_GetResults``, then 
it should be trivial to use the *PICO* version called ``PICO_GetResults`` instead.
The *PICO* version will fall back on the CAMB version if called with parameters
for which it cannot calculate the relevant quantities. 

To install the CAMB plugin, do the following:

* Copy ``plugins/camb/pico_camb.f90`` to the folder containing your code
* Add a call ``fpico_load(file)`` to load a *PICO* datafile.
* Replace ``CAMB_GetResults`` with ``PICO_GetResults``
* Compile your code, making sure to use the correct include/link flags (see `Linking`_).



CosmoMC Plugin
--------------

*PICO* can also be plugged into CosmoMC. 

To install the CosmoMC plugin, do the following:

* Copy ``plugins/cosmomc/CMB_Cls_pico.f90`` and ``plugins/camb/pico_camb.f90`` 
  to the CosmoMC source folder
* Replace ``driver.f90`` in the CosmoMC source folder with the one in ``plugins/cosmomc``
* Add the line ``CMB_Cls_pico.o: pico_camb.o``
* In your CosmoMC Makefile, replace references to ``CMB_Cls_simple`` 
  with references to ``CMB_Cls_pico`` 
* Add the correct include/link flags to the Makefile (see `Linking`_).
* Add the a key ``pico_datafile`` to your parameter file.


CosmoSlik Plugin
----------------

To install the CosmoSlik plugin, copy ``plugins/cosmoslik/pico.py`` to 
the ``cosmoslik/models/`` folder.
